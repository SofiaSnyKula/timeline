This project involved the creation of a responsive animated timeline web application using jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
The application was designed to display important events in my life, and it adapts to various screen sizes to ensure accessibility on different devices. 
The "Animated Timeline" project is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Its purpose is to showcase significant events throughout the creator's life in a visually appealing 
and interactive timeline format. The timeline is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing across various devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Key Features:
⦁	Responsive Design: The timeline adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS flexbox and media queries, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
⦁	Event Display: Each event in the timeline is represented by a clickable card (div.event) containing the date and description of the event.
⦁	Modal for Event Details: Clicking on an event card opens a modal window (div.modal) that displays a corresponding image and a caption. This feature enhances user interaction by providing visual context for each milestone.
⦁	Back to Top Button: A floating "Back to Top" button allows users to quickly navigate back to the beginning of the timeline, enhancing usability especially on longer pages.
⦁	Styling and UX: The project employs a clean and modern design with a yellow-green color scheme for headers and footers, enhancing readability and visual appeal.
Technologies Used:
⦁	HTML: Structure of the webpage.
⦁	CSS: Styling and layout adjustments for responsiveness.
⦁	jQuery: JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation and event handling, enabling interactive features like modal windows.
⦁	Media Queries: Ensures responsiveness and optimal display on various devices.
⦁	Modal Techniques: Implemented to display event images and captions upon user interaction.
Project Outcome: The "Animated Timeline" successfully combines technical proficiency with creative presentation, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring personal milestones. 
It meets project requirements by integrating interactive elements such as modal windows and a responsive design, ensuring accessibility across devices. 
The project not only demonstrates skills in web development but also highlights effective use of jQuery for dynamic content presentation.
